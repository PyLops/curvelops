Welcome to curvelops's documentation!
=====================================

Python wrapper for `CurveLab <http://www.curvelet.org>`_'s 2D and 3D curvelet transforms. It uses the `PyLops <https://pylops.readthedocs.io/>`_ design framework to provide the forward and inverse curvelet transforms as matrix-free linear operations. Check out `some examples <https://github.com/PyLops/curvelops/tree/main/examples>`_ or view the documentation below.
