Overview
========

Curvelops is part of the PyLops ecossystem, an open-source Python library
focused on providing a backend-agnostic, idiomatic, matrix-free library of
linear operators and related computations. Curvelops provides 2D and 3D
Curvelet transforms via `CurveLab <http://www.curvelet.org>`__.
